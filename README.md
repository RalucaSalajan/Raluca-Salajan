+ Hello, I’m Raluca Salajan and this is my GitHub portfolio.

+ I’m a newbie in Quality Assurance Software Testing.

+ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Testing opportunities.

Currently, I'm taking this QA course: https://www.udemy.com/course/testare-manuala-si-automata-curs-qa/.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. 
I consider myself optimistic, curious, and I have a strong desire to learn new things.
I’m familiar with tools like Jira, TestLink, Postman, WebdriverIO, and Cypress.
