:cherry_blossom: Hello, I’m Raluca Salajan and this is my GitHub portfolio.

:four_leaf_clover: I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing.

:seedling: I’m looking to collaborate on Software Testing opportunities.


Preparing using two online QA courses, where I learned about agile, manual testing, API testing using Postman, writing bug reports & test cases, automation testing using CypressJS and basic concepts of MySQL.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. 
I consider myself optimistic, curious, and I have a strong desire to learn new things.
