:cherry_blossom: Hello, Iâ€™m Raluca Salajan and this is my GitHub portfolio.

Preparing using two online QA courses, where I learned about agile, manual testing, API testing using Postman, writing bug reports & test cases, automation testing using CypressJS and basic concepts of MySQL.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. 
I consider myself optimistic, curious, and I have a strong desire to learn new things.
